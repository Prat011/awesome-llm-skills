## What Are LLM Skills?

LLM Skills are customizable workflows that teach LLM how to perform specific tasks according to your unique requirements. Skills enable LLM to execute tasks in a repeatable, standardized manner across all LLM platforms.

### Key Features

- **Composable** - Combine multiple skills for complex workflows.
- **Portable** - Use the same skill across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and the API.
- **Efficient** - Claude loads only what's needed for optimal performance.
- **Powerful** - Include executable code for technical reliability.

Skills can codify your organization's processes, brand guidelines, workflows, and expertise into reusable components that Claude applies automatically when needed.
